这几天和几个沙雕高中同学一起吃鸡，突然有个同学跟我讲说什么和平精英里面新模式有个防空洞可以炸。然后我们就去康了一下。

于是乎，我们丢个手榴弹炸开了防空洞，里面有个办公室的形象。然后有一本书可以读。（话说这材质也太像minecraft了）

是摩尔斯电码

```摩尔斯
- .... . -. . -..- - - .- .-. --. . -
```

翻译以后是THENEXTTARGET (下一个目标？)，并不知道在指什么

后来利用万能的baidu了解到还有其他彩蛋，

某官方发过\u004a\u0043

显然 ，unicode编码，翻过来就是JC，发给微信公众号，会给一个地图，指出我们当时去的防空洞位置。

然后官方微博上有一个计算机上面有一堆二进制的编码，

![computer](http://q636fdwwj.bkt.clouddn.com/computer%20.JPG)

二话不说上jo本

```python
code = "0100001101101111011001000110010101101110011000010110110101100101001110100101010101101110011001000110010101110010011001110111001001101111011101010110111001100100"
for i in range(len(code)//8):
	print(chr(int(code[i*8:i*8+8],2)), end='')
```

结果是：Codename:Underground(代号：地下)，一本小说

> 谷歌到了简介：In the near future, tensions have begun to rise between different countries fighting over resources and other political issues. Over time, the situation begins to worsen and threats of a potential nuclear war start to arise. As the problems are rapidly getting worse, a young boy named Arki and his family, who live in a small city in France, are living another seemingly normal day getting ready to go throughout their day, but something very bad has happened. Panic begins to spread all throughout the town as they begin to flee to underground shelters. Life underground was very different, and nobody was allowed to leave, but Arki is very curious and wants to learn more about what really happened on that horrifying day.

可能下个图是地下城？我也不太懂。
